		<h2>Watching As I Fall</h2>

		<p>Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of lies
Thinking I'm okay, but they're saying otherwise
Tell me how I look but can't look me in the eyes
Watching as I say this and then I do that
Telling them the old words but in a new rap
Then I change my mind up and make them lose track
Shit I'm inconsistent I thought they knew that</p>
