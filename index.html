	<h2>Watching As I Fall</h2><br>
	<br>
	<p>Excuse me while I kiss the sky</p>
	<p>Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of lies</p>
	<p>Thinking I'm okay, but they're saying otherwise</p>
	<p>Tell me how I look but can't look me in the eyes</p>
	<p>Watching as I say this and then I do that</p>
	<p>Telling them the old words but in a new rap</p>
	<p>Then I change my mind up and make them lose track</p>
	<p>Shit I'm inconsistent I thought they knew that</p><br>
	<p>Maybe I should be more grateful</p>
	<p>That I had to watch it all come undone</p>
	<p>Holding so tight to the edge is painful</p>
	<p>But I can't ignore it I know</p><br>
	<p>They're watching as I fall, they're staring as I go</p>
	<p>I gave until my soul hurt, and never told them so</p>
	<p>They're watching as I fall, to somewhere down below</p>
	<p>But maybe I'm just falling, to get somewhere they won't</p>
